## Description 
Have extra books lying around and want some new material? Our site allows you to post your books and borrow from your local neighbors! You post your books and are able to search through books posted in your area. You then create a social contract with the other user swapping books. Once communication begins youâ€™re ready to enjoy your new books after pick up!

## Usage 
This project combined everything that we learned at Georgia Tech Full Stack BootCamp. We used the MERN stack, Full CRUD functionality, Google Books API, Hashing password and jwt for user information. We are using Bulma for styling and used DBdiagram.io, Sketch, and Trello to lay out the project.
